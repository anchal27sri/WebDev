            Bucky, THANK YOU! I'm loving your instruction.  I started way back in the day, when I was a kid, with Basic language. Then went to DOS, later.

I'm having a blast learning from you. My goal is to get into cyber security. Any tips or advice to share with an "old man"? Thanks again!

           Avengers: Endgame is a very good film. It is one of the top action films that 
           has involved comedy, action and emotion together. Most entertaining movie of the 
           decade by many people.
